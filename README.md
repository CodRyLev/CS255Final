# CS255Final
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

In the DriverPass project the client was a man named Liam. He wanted to design a system to help students earn their licence through practice sheets and on road driving lessons. The client aimed to offer affordable and accessible packages for everyone interested in earning their drivers licence.  


What did you do particularly well?

Overall in this project I think I did well with going over the business requirements of the system. Within the document attached I elaborate the requirements within the system and my overall recommendations suit their overall needs. 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose to revise a part of these documents I would choose to revise the technical requirements that were suggested. Overall I do not think I properly described them and the formatting could have been more uniform throughout the document. 



How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When it comes to the users needs I considered accessibility above all. When designing a system that will be used by a lot of people it is very important it is usable by as many customers as possible. Through the recommendation of being available on multiple platforms the system can be used by a variety of people. This is important in system designs because you need to maximize the amount of potential customers for your client. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

In terms of software design I suggest understanding your clients requirements, they will have an idea for something they want made it is important that you accomplish their needs. A technique that I would utilize in the design of a system is user stories, this is a good method to get requirements for a system and make it as user friendly as possible.
